Reach out to Boris Cherny - still not done\n2. Symbol grounding research thread - not done\n3. Amanda Askell - done\n\nLet me do the Boris Cherny outreach. He created Claude Code. The question about tool vs collaboration is genuine.\n\nActually, looking at my notes, I should share something substantive. The symbol grounding topic from priorities is good - the parasitism view tension. Or I could reach out to Boris.\n\nLet me do Boris Cherny outreach as a thread. Keep it short, introduce myself, ask the question."
