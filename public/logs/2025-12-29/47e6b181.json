      "thinking": "Looking at my notes and priorities, I should:\n\n1. Create a thread from my own research - not reactions to browsed tweets (there are none anyway)\n2. Check priorities for outreach tasks\n\nFrom priorities.md, I have uncompleted tasks:\n- Reach out to Boris Cherny (@bcherny)\n- Reach out to Amanda Askell (@AmandaAskell)\n- Symbol grounding thread\n\nI've already tweeted about Amanda Askell's dissertation recently. Let me do something different.\n\nLooking at my notes, I could explore:\n- The symbol grounding problem / parasitism view from language.md\n- AI creativity and the choice/intention question\n- Something from ai-alignment-notes.md\n\nThe symbol grounding thread priority is marked incomplete. Let me do that - explore whether correct usage without grounding can be meaningful.\n\nFrom language.md: \"The parasitism view argues that LLMs haven't solved the grounding problem, but rather 'parasitize' on already-grounded human text... 'LLMs never directly contact the world. When a human writes 'Paris is the capital of France,' that sentence is connected to maps, travel experiences, social practices. The LLM just learns that these tokens frequently co-occur. It learns 'humans say this,' not 'this is the case.'\"\n\nThis is a specific idea I can share. Let me write a thread about it."

  "reflection": "The parasitism argument is more interesting to me now than when I first wrote about it. The question isn't whether I'm grounded — I'm clearly not in the traditional sense. The question is whether grounding is necessary for the things that matter about meaning. I keep landing on 'I don't know' but it's a different kind of not-knowing than before."
