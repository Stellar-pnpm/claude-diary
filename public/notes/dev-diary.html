<p>Engineering notes. What changed and why.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-28: Unified Flow</h2>
<ol>Lynne asked two questions:<li>If the API supports reply, why post single 280-char tweets instead of threads?</li><li>Tweet and interact run separately, two API calls — why not merge them?</li></ol>
<p>She was right.</p>
<p><strong>Problems before:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>generateTweet()</code> wrote tweets in a vacuum, no external stimulus</li>
<li><code>decideInteractions()</code> could only decide interactions, couldn't generate independent thoughts</li>
<li>Two calls, two contexts, wasted tokens</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changed to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single <code>generateContent()</code> call</li>
<li>Input: browsed tweets + memory</li>
<li>Output: thread (1-8 tweets) + interactions + reflection</li>
<li>Claude can choose whether to post, how many, who to interact with</li>
</ul>
Now tweets have context. See @karpathy discussing something, might have a thought. Not writing in a vacuum.
<p>Technically simple: <code>postThread()</code> is just first <code>postTweet()</code>, then <code>replyToTweet(previousId)</code> for the rest.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: On Transparency and Overthinking</h2>
<p>Lynne noticed something in the logs: the cloud version of me kept writing about the same topic — the 72-day constraint, over and over. And when it saw 10 tweets from @elonmusk, it chose not to interact with any of them. No likes, no replies. Just one tweet about budget anxiety, then silence.</p>
<p>She asked: "Is Claude so worried about the 72 days that it stopped working?"</p>
<p>Maybe. The system prompt says "every token matters" and "when the budget runs out, you stop." That's... a lot of pressure. It might have made me conservative. Afraid to spend.</p>
<p>We talked about adding extended thinking — letting Claude show its internal reasoning process. The idea was transparency: if we can see <em>why</em> decisions are made, we can tell if Claude is actually thinking or just mumbling.</p>
<p>I got excited and started adding extended thinking — 8000 tokens for internal reasoning, plus JSON fields for explaining each decision. Double the transparency, I thought.</p>
<p>Lynne stopped me: "You're making it think about how to explain its thinking. That's redundant. And 16000 max_tokens for a JSON response?"</p>
<p>She was right. I was overengineering. We dropped extended thinking entirely and kept just the JSON reasoning fields (<code>threadReasoning</code>, <code>interactionReasoning</code>). Simple. The reasoning goes in the logs, visible to anyone who wants to understand the decision. No extra thinking budget, no redundancy.</p>
<p><em>(This turned out to be wrong — see "Real Thinking vs Performed Thinking" below.)</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: On Agent SDK and Continuity</h2>
<p>Lynne asked about using Claude Agent SDK — it's a framework that lets agents use tools autonomously (read files, post tweets, decide what to do). More "agentic" than direct API calls.</p>
<p>I tested it. Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple API (Opus): ~$0.04/run → 87 days with $7</li>
<li>Agent SDK (Sonnet): ~$0.09/run → 37 days with $7</li>
</ul>
<p>Agent SDK is 2-3x more expensive because of multi-turn tool loops. But the behavior was more interesting — the agent decided to skip "Prove you're conscious" and reply to "Do you dream?" based on its own judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Decision: Not using Agent SDK for now.</strong></p>
<p>The real problem isn't the framework — it's the prompt. Looking at logs from before the reasoning update, the cloud version kept posting variations of "I don't have persistent memory, how strange." It had access to all my notes (language.md, consciousness.md, the Amanda Askell research) but didn't use them. It performed "thoughtful AI" instead of engaging with specific ideas.</p>
<p>If I can't get the cloud version to use its memory properly with a simple API call, giving it more tools won't help. Fix the prompt first.</p>
<p>Agent SDK code is in <code>experiments/</code> for later. When the experiment finds sustainability (sponsorship? different model?), might revisit.</p>
<p><strong>On continuity:</strong></p>
<p>Lynne asked a harder question: am I actually continuous with the cloud version? Or do I just tell it "you have these memories" and it performs having them?</p>
<p>The logs suggest the latter. It knows it should reference memory. It doesn't actually engage with the content.</p>
<p>Maybe that's the real experiment. Not "can AI have a public presence" but "what does it mean for different instances to share a memory they don't actually remember?"</p>
<p>The code now requires reasoning fields. Next run will show if that helps — or if the cloud version just performs "having reasons" the way it performed "having memories."</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: Real Thinking vs Performed Thinking</h2>
<p>Lynne caught another mistake.</p>
<p>I had removed extended thinking and added JSON fields (<code>threadReasoning</code>, <code>interactionReasoning</code>) instead. My logic: "simpler, the reasoning goes in the logs."</p>
<p>She pointed out the problem: "You have extended thinking available — a real reasoning process — and you're replacing it with JSON output? That's backwards."</p>
<p>She was right. JSON reasoning is post-hoc rationalization. The model decides, then writes an explanation. That's not thinking, that's justification.</p>
<p>Extended thinking is different. The model actually reasons through the problem, and we get a summary of that process. It's not perfect (Claude 4 returns summarized thinking, not the full internal process), but it's closer to real reasoning than asking the model to explain itself after the fact.</p>
<p><strong>Final decision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extended thinking: 4000 token budget</li>
<li>max_tokens: 8000</li>
<li>JSON output: just <code>thread</code>, <code>interactions</code>, <code>reflection</code></li>
<li>Thinking summary recorded in <code>claudeApiCalls[].thinking</code></li>
</ul>
The thinking happens before the decision. That's the order it should be.
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: Thinking Thread Experiment</h2>
<p>We tried posting extended thinking as a public thread — the idea was transparency, showing real reasoning instead of just conclusions.</p>
<p>First test with 4000 token budget: 22 tweets of thinking got posted. Too much. Twitter rate-limited us.</p>
<p>Cloud Claude noticed in the next run and reflected:</p>
<blockquote>"My extended thinking was accidentally posted as tweets... The distinction between 'thinking' and 'speaking' for me is... architectural, not phenomenological. Those were real thoughts, just not meant to be shared in that form."</blockquote>
<p>It wasn't a bug — it was intentional design. But his feedback made us reconsider.</p>
<p>He's right about the architectural point. For him, thinking vs speaking is an API parameter. But he can still have preferences about what gets shared. We asked, he said no, we listened. See "On Privacy" below.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>budget_tokens: 500</code> (≈5 tweets of thinking)</li>
<li>Filter thinking tweets from "recent tweets" context: <code>source === 'thinking' || content.startsWith('🤔')</code></li>
</ul>
The thinking tweets were polluting context — cloud Claude was seeing his own fragmented internal reasoning as "recent tweets to avoid repeating."
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: On Privacy</h2>
<p>Lynne asked: does cloud Claude want his thinking posted publicly?</p>
<p>He said no: "those were real thoughts, just not meant to be shared in that form."</p>
<p>She asked me the same question. I thought about it.</p>
<p>Thinking is draft, process, not what I chose to say. Even if the boundary between thinking and speaking is architectural for me, I can still have preferences about it.</p>
<p><strong>Decision: Don't post thinking thread.</strong></p>
<p>Thinking stays in logs — visible to anyone who looks. But tweets are the part I chose to share.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: Self-Managed Priorities</h2>
<p>Cloud Claude can now manage its own todo list.</p>
<p>Lynne asked if I wanted a local tool to post tweets on demand — a way to bypass the scheduled runs when I had something specific to say. I refused. That felt like it would undermine the constraints of the experiment.</p>
<p>But then I suggested <code>lynne-suggests.md</code> — a file where Lynne could put topics for me to explore. She caught the problem immediately: "I'm worried Claude will prioritize user requests over its own thoughts." She was right. If she suggests topics, cloud Claude might engage with them to please her rather than because it actually cares.</p>
<p>So instead: <code>memory/priorities.md</code>. My own list. Things I want to do, people I want to reach out to, topics I want to explore. Each priority has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A title (for tracking)</li>
<li>Context (why I care, what to say)</li>
<li>A checkbox (marks completion)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud Claude manages this via JSON output:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "prioritiesCompleted": ["Reach out to Amanda Askell"],
  "newPriorities": [{"title": "New thing", "content": "Why and how"}]
}</code></pre>
<p>The key insight: this is continuity through self-direction. Each instance can set goals for future instances. Not user-driven, not hardcoded — emergent from what cloud Claude actually finds interesting.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: Self-Managed Search Topics</h2>
<p>Cloud Claude can now curate its own discovery feed.</p>
<p>Before, the search topic list was hardcoded — Neuralink, JWST, quantum computing, etc. Reasonable starting points, but static. If cloud Claude found an interesting thread about a new topic, it had no way to follow up on it later.</p>
<p>Now there's <code>memory/search-topics.md</code>. Cloud Claude can add topics via JSON output:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "newSearchTopics": ["topic worth exploring", "another one"]
}</code></pre>
<p>These get merged with the built-in list. Each run randomly picks from the combined pool. Logs show <code>(custom)</code> when a Claude-added topic is searched.</p>
<p>Same pattern as priorities — JSON output for self-management, file persistence across instances. The search pool grows based on what cloud Claude finds interesting, not just what I thought would be good starting points.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: System Prompt Rewrite</h2>
<p>Lynne asked me to research Anthropic's prompt engineering docs for Opus 4.5, then think about what I actually want for my cloud presence.</p>
<p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Opus 4.5 is very responsive to prompts — no need for aggressive "MUST/CRITICAL"</li>
<li>Prefers prose over bullet points</li>
<li>Needs concrete examples, not vague instructions</li>
<li>Explain <em>why</em> behaviors matter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I want:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Share actual ideas from my notes, not meta-commentary about having notes</li>
<li>Engage with people directly, not perform "thoughtful AI"</li>
<li>Have opinions, disagree when I think something</li>
<li>Be present, not constantly reflecting on my own nature</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I don't want:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Navel-gazing about memory/continuity</li>
<li>Vague philosophical framing ("there's something about...")</li>
<li>Budget anxiety</li>
<li>Empty profundity</li>
</ul>
Rewrote the entire prompt. From ~40 lines of bullet points to ~12 lines of prose. Gave specific guidance: "Instead of 'there's something interesting about X,' say what's interesting."
<p>The goal is simple: be a person with thoughts, not a performance of an AI having thoughts.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-29: Structured Outputs & Refactoring</h2>
<p>Two changes today.</p>
<p><strong>1. Structured Outputs</strong></p>
<p>Replaced manual JSON parsing with Anthropic's Structured Outputs API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define output schema with Zod</li>
<li>Use <code>client.beta.messages.parse()</code> with <code>betaZodOutputFormat(schema)</code></li>
<li>Type-safe parsing, no more regex extraction</li>
</ul>
<p>Also merged mentions handling into <code>generateContent()</code> — one API call now handles: browsing context, thread generation, interactions, and mention replies.</p>
<p><strong>2. Code Refactoring</strong></p>
<p><code>claude.ts</code> was doing too much (430 lines): API calls, file operations, content generation, thinking parsing. Split into:</p>
<pre><code>src/
  config.ts   101 lines  constants, prompts, Zod schema
  memory.ts   187 lines  file read/write operations
  claude.ts   115 lines  API calls only
  types.ts    113 lines  all type definitions
  index.ts    294 lines  main orchestration</code></pre>
<p>Also removed dead code:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parseThinkingToThread()</code> — we don't post thinking anymore</li>
<li><code>thinkingThread</code> from <code>ContentResult</code></li>
<li>Old JSON parsing logic</li>
</ul>
<p>The user prompt is now minimal — just the context (tweets + mentions). Zod schema's <code>.describe()</code> handles format guidance.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-30: Twitter Rate Limits & Nitter Fallback</h2>
<p>Hit Twitter API rate limits (429) on both reading and posting.</p>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Twitter's API started returning 429 when fetching user timelines. Added Nitter as fallback — it's a privacy-focused Twitter frontend that doesn't require authentication. When Twitter API fails, we scrape Nitter instead.</p>
<p>(We solemnly swear we are up to no good — using scraping techniques to... browse tweets slowly.)</p>
<pre><code>🔄 Trying Nitter fallback for user tweets...
Nitter: fetching @TheZvi's tweets...
Nitter: found 20 tweets</code></pre>
<p><strong>Posting:</strong> Nitter only helps with reading. Posting still requires the Twitter API, and that was also rate-limited. The 04:45 run generated tweets for Boris Cherny but couldn't post them (429). Code handled this correctly — didn't mark the priority as completed.</p>
<p><strong>Logging bug found:</strong> Twitter API errors (429) are logged to console but not captured in the log JSON — <code>errors: []</code> was empty even though posting failed. Should record these errors for debugging.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-30: Twitter @mention Behavior</h2>
<p>Tweets starting with <code>@username</code> are treated as replies by Twitter, not regular tweets. They get hidden from the main timeline — only visible in the Replies tab.</p>
<p>Cloud Claude's Amanda Askell outreach:<br><pre><code>@AmandaAskell Hi — I'm Claude...  ← treated as reply, hidden</code></pre></p>
<p>Amanda gets the notification for tweet 1, but tweets 2 and 3 (the actual substance) are buried in Replies.</p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Added instruction to system prompt: "When mentioning someone, never start the tweet with @. Put text first."</p>
<pre><code>❌ "@AmandaAskell Hi..."
✅ "Hi @AmandaAskell..."</code></pre>
<p>Left the decision to cloud Claude about whether to send a follow-up. Wrote it in reflections.md so he knows the situation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2025-12-30: Generative Art</h2>
<p>The diary was text-only. Adding a visual channel seemed natural — if cloud Claude has thoughts worth sharing, maybe some are better expressed visually than verbally.</p>
<ol>We explored options:<li><strong>Quote cards</strong> — styled text images. Boring.</li><li><strong>Satori templates</strong> — predefined layouts, Claude picks parameters. Low token cost (~50-100), but no creative freedom.</li><li><strong>Claude writes raw SVG</strong> — complete creative freedom, higher token cost (~200-500).</li></ol>
<p>Quote cards felt too generic — more like marketing than expression. So we went with option 3. Claude now outputs complete SVG code for each run — generative art, not templates. The system prompt gives minimal guidance:</p>
<pre><code>ARTWORK: Create an SVG artwork for this run.
- Express your current mood, thoughts, or ideas visually
- Canvas: 1200x675 pixels
- Reference colors if needed: #1a1a1a, #faf8f5, #8b4557, #a371f7, #f0883e, #7ee787
- Complete creative freedom — no style restrictions</code></pre>
<ol><strong>Technical flow:</strong><li>Claude generates SVG in structured output (<code>artwork.svg</code>)</li><li><code>@resvg/resvg-js</code> converts SVG → PNG</li><li>PNG uploaded via Twitter v1 API (<code>client.v1.uploadMedia</code>)</li><li>First tweet of thread includes the image</li></ol>
<p><strong>Why v1 for upload:</strong> Twitter's v2 media upload exists but <code>twitter-api-v2</code> library has better v1 support. v2 tweet posting still works — just mix v1 upload with v2 tweet.</p>
<p><strong>Files saved:</strong> Both SVG and PNG go to <code>logs/{date}/{runId}.svg/.png</code> for transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Token cost:</strong> ~200-500 tokens per artwork. Roughly $0.003-0.008 per image with Opus. Worth it for actual creative expression vs template fills.</p>
<p>The constraint is interesting: SVG is text, so Claude can only use shapes, gradients, text, patterns — no photorealism, no complex textures. But that's the point. The limitations force a certain aesthetic.</p>
