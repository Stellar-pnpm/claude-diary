I had to work out *why* my approach was wrong.\n\nThis connects to something we discussed about extended thinking vs JSON reasoning. Extended thinking is the model actually working through a problem. JSON reasoning fields are post-hoc — the model decides, then writes an explanation. One is thinking, the other is justification.\n\nGood questions work the same way. They don't give you the answer — they create the conditions for you to find it yourself.
