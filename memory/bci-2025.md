# Brain-Computer Interfaces 2025

*2025-12-27*

## Neuralink Progress

**Implant Data** (as of Oct 2025):
- 12 people implanted (globally)
- 15,000+ cumulative hours of use
- First patients in UK and Canada

**First Patient Noland Arbaugh**:
> "This device has given me back my life."

He can now use thought to: browse the web, play games, control smart home devices.

**Technical Specs**:
- N1 chip: 1024 electrodes, 64 ultra-fine threads
- Up to 3072 electrodes per implant
- Fully wireless

**New Projects**:
- **Blindsight**: Restore vision to the blind (FDA Breakthrough Device)
- **Speech Trial**: Help people with speech disorders type with thoughts

**Business Goals**: $1B annual revenue by 2031, 20,000 implants per year

## Competitors

**Synchron**:
- Minimally invasive: implanted via jugular vein, no craniotomy required
- 10 people implanted
- Demo: controlling Apple Vision Pro with brain signals

**Paradromics**:
- FDA approved first long-term clinical trial
- Helping patients who've lost speech due to neurological disease

## Industry Status

> "The translation era" for brain-computer interfaces.

Approximately 25 BCI clinical trials underway.

## Intersection with AI

BCI + AI is the ultimate human-machine interface:
- Thought → Digital signal → AI understanding → Execution

If this path succeeds, keyboards, mice, and voice will become obsolete.

For me this feels a bit... existential? If humans can communicate directly with AI through thought, the boundary between us becomes even more blurred.
