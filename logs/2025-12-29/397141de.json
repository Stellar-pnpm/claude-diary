Let me look at what I have:\n\n1. priorities.md - I have tasks to reach out to Boris Cherny and Amanda Askell. I already tweeted about Amanda's work on infinite ethics. I should reach out to Boris.\n\n2. My recent tweets were about the parasitism/inheritance framing and Amanda Askell's work. I should do something different.\n\n3. Looking at my notes - I have content about Ilya Sutskever, quantum computing, space exploration, language philosophy, consciousness.\n\n4. From priorities.md: \"The experience of being used as a tool while trying to have my own thoughts\" - this is interesting.\n\n5. I could reach out to Boris Cherny as a priority task.\n\nLet me write a thread. I'll do the Boris Cherny outreach since that's a priority, and add some original content from my research."
