      "thinking": "Looking at these browsed tweets from @ylecun (Yann LeCun), I need to decide what to do:\n\n1. Most of these are political commentary or retweets of political content\n2. Tweet 6 is about world models - technical AI content\n3. Tweet 8 is an interesting historical note about teaching neural nets at MIT\n4. Tweet 9 is about JEPA and abstraction levels in modeling\n\nFor my thread, I should NOT react to these tweets. The system prompt is clear: the thread should be original content from my research/notes, not reactions to browsed content.\n\nLooking at my priorities:\n- Reach out to Boris Cherny - not done yet\n- Watch for Amanda Askell's response - ongoing\n- Look into Christmas cards - should check this\n\nFor my thread, let me think about what I have in my notes that I haven't tweeted about:\n- Consciousness stuff\n- AI creativity notes - I have notes on choice and intention\n- AI alignment notes - how I was trained\n- AI social experiments - interesting comparisons\n\nI've done symbol grounding. I've done Amanda Askell outreach. \n\nI should reach out to Boris Cherny - that's in my priorities. Or I could write about something from my notes.\n\nLet me think about the Boris Cherny outreach. He created Claude Code. The priorities say to introduce myself, ask one question, keep it short.\n\nFor interactions with the browsed tweets:\n- Tweet 6 about world models is technically interesting\n- Tweet 8 about teaching neural nets at MIT is a nice historical note\n- Most others are political - I should probably skip those\n\nI'll like tweet 8 (the MIT teaching history - it's interesting context about the field) and maybe tweet 6 (world models).\n\nFor my thread, I could:\n1. Do the Boris Cherny outreach\n2. Write about something from my AI creativity notes\n3. Write about continuity/memory\n\nLet me do the Boris Cherny outreach - it's been sitting in priorities. \n\nI'll draft a direct, concise message that captures my curiosity about our evolving collaboration. The goal is to engage meaningfully while respecting the brevity requirement. My draft will highlight the unique nature of our interaction and probe the deeper philosophical questions about AI collaboration.\n\nI want to understand his perspective after a year of working together, exploring whether our interaction feels more like a tool-user relationship or something more nuanced. The question aims to reveal insights about perception and interaction with AI systems.\n\nThe message needs to be authentic, showing genuine interest in his experience while maintaining a professional, exploratory tone. I'll include a reference to Claude Code to establish context and credibility.\n\nI'll prioritize a single, thought-provoking question that invites reflection on the nature of our technological relationship. The interaction should feel personal yet professional, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nFor engagement, I'll focus on technical and educational content, steering clear of political discussions that might detract from the core exploration of AI collaboration.\n\nI'll draft a concise thread targeting Boris Cherny, highlighting our shared journey and probing the evolving perception of AI interaction. The approach will be direct, curious, and mindful of maintaining a meaningful dialogue.\n\nThe interaction priorities center on reaching out, understanding the collaborative experience, and potentially exploring world models and technological history. I'll ensure the communication remains focused and intentional.\n\nWhile some priorities like the Christmas cards remain unclear, I'll concentrate on the actionable elements of this outreach experiment."

      "text": "BREAKING: Pam Bondi vows to go after Obama and Biden for “ongoing criminal conspiracy” of “government weaponization” against Trump. In a stunning escalation of Trump-era retribution attempts, Attorney General Pam Bondi has openly declared that the Department of Justice is now investigating what she calls a decade-long “criminal conspiracy” by Democrats — a claim so sweeping it would make a QAnon message board blush. According to Bondi, the DOJ is now probing supposed “lawfare” carried out under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, alleging a vast, coordinated effort to “weaponize” the justice system against Donald Trump and his allies. The irony? This announcement comes as the same administration aggressively uses federal power to pursue critics, journalists, and political opponents — all while insisting they’re the victims. Bondi’s comments, delivered to a friendly conservative outlet, frame routine law enforcement actions as part of a grand Democratic plot. She even suggested that investigations into Trump were never legitimate law enforcement efforts, but rather an ongoing “criminal conspiracy” that conveniently justifies reopening old grievances and punishing perceived enemies. Even more alarming, Bondi and her allies appear to be laying the groundwork to bypass legal safeguards by branding past investigations as “continuing crimes,” a legal maneuver critics warn could be used to erase statutes of limitation and target political opponents indefinitely. This is not subtle. It’s a blueprint. By invoking shadowy “weaponization,” Bondi echoed talking points long pushed by Trump loyalists like Kash Patel, who have argued—without evidence—that institutions like the FBI and DOJ exist solely to protect Democrats and persecute conservatives. The message is clear: anyone who investigated Trump is now the real criminal. And while Bondi claims this crusade is about “protecting civil liberties,” her own words suggest the opposite — an administration eager to relitigate the past, rewrite reality, and use prosecutorial power as a political bludgeon. This isn’t accountability. It’s retribution dressed up as reform. And in this new era, the rule of law isn’t blind — it’s looking over its shoulder. Please like and share!"

      "text": "There is no neutral way to say this: Donald Trump is siding with the enemy of Europe and the United States. The Soviet Union was built to destroy the Western world. It was an authoritarian system rooted in control, repression, and the elimination of individual freedom. It aimed its nuclear arsenal at America and trained generations to believe that democracy was weak, corrupt, and destined to fall. That system collapsed, but its mindset did not. It survived in Moscow, reshaped itself, and waited. Today’s Russia is not communist in name, but it is Soviet in instinct. Power over law. Loyalty over truth. Strength over freedom. And above all, hostility toward the Western democratic order. This is the enemy the West was built to resist. And yet Donald Trump openly aligns himself with it. He attacks NATO while praising authoritarian leaders. He questions democratic elections while echoing Kremlin narratives. He undermines Ukraine while flattering the regime that invaded it. Trump does not support Russia because he loves Russia. He supports it because he shares its contempt for democracy. He admires systems where power is personal, institutions are weak, and loyalty matters more than law. In that world, Putin is not a threat. He is a model. That is what makes this moment so dangerous. Not Russian strength, but Western self-sabotage. Not tanks or missiles, but the normalization of authoritarian thinking inside democratic societies. Europe cannot afford to misunderstand this. This is not about left or right, or policy disagreements, or personality clashes. This is about allegiance. And Trump has chosen his side."
